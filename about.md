Hi, I am a PhD candidate at the [Charles and Louise Travers department of Political Science](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/), and a Research Associate at the [Center for the Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome to my website!

My broad research interests lie in comparative politics, the political economy of development and the politics of South Asia. My dissertation and book project focuses on how the right-wing religiously conservative Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mobilizes women into public spaces despite its ideology of _Hindutva_ that confines women to domestic spaces. I triangulate extensive qualitative and ethnographic research conducted over a span of three years with experimental methods to show how the BJP's articulation of politics as _seva_, a powerful norm of selfless service that overlaps women's domestic caregiving roles as mothers and wives, helps create the conditions for women's entry into politics. Women see politics as an extension of their domestic roles. At the same time, politics as social service does not challenge men’s authority within the family, or patriarchal structures of power at large. Consequently, men unblock women’s participation when it is articulated in terms of _seva_.  

My research has been generously supported by the [APSA-NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/ddrig), the [Weiss Family Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/governance-initiative), the University of Notre Dame's [Global Religion Research Initiative](https://grri.nd.edu/), the University of Gothenburg's [Governance and Local Development Program](https://gld.gu.se/), the [APSA Centennial Center's Women and Politics Fund](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/), and [UC Berkeley's Graduate Division](https://grad.berkeley.edu/), [Center for Contemporary India](https://indiacenter.berkeley.edu/), and [Center for Right-Wing Studies](https://crws.berkeley.edu/).

### Teaching
#### UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Some of my teaching materials for the class are available here (coming soon!). Some in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!).

#### Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
