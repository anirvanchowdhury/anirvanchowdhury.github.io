![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and the Aung San Suu Kyi Endowed Chair in Asian Democracy at the University of Louisville's [department of political science](https://louisville.edu/politicalscience) and the [Center for Asian Democracy](https://louisville.edu/asiandemocracy). 

In AY 2023-2024, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Weatherhead Scholars Program at Harvard University's [Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/). I earned my PhD at the [Charles and Louise Travers department of Political Science](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was a Research Associate at the [Center for the Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/).

I study the political economy of development, with a focus on social norms and political participation. The overarching focus of my research is the possibilities---and potential hurdles---in making politics more inclusive for marginalized groups. I examine this in the context of women and ethnic minorities in India.

My research on gender and religious conservatism has received several awards. My book project, tentatively titled [__Domesticating Politics: How Religiously Conservative Parties Mobilize Women in India__](https://anirvanchowdhury.github.io/book/), was awarded with the APSA's best dissertation awards in Political Economy (the Mancur Olson award); Religion and Politics (the Aaron Wildavsky award); Political Communication (the Thomas E. Patterson award); and Women, Gender, and Politics Research. Prior to this, I co-authored a meta-analysis of six field experiments on information and accountability as part of the Metaketa project, which was adjudged as the Best Book by the Experimental Research Section.

My research has been generously supported by the [APSA-NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/ddrig), the [APSA Centennial Center's Women and Politics Fund](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/), the [Weiss Family Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/governance-initiative), the [Global Religion Research Initiative](https://grri.nd.edu/), the [Governance and Local Development Program](https://gld.gu.se/), and [UC Berkeley's Graduate Division](https://grad.berkeley.edu/), [Insitute of South Asia Studies](https://southasia.berkeley.edu/), [Center for Contemporary India](https://indiacenter.berkeley.edu/), and [Center for Right-Wing Studies](https://crws.berkeley.edu/).

### Teaching
#### UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Some of my teaching materials for the class are available here (coming soon!). Some in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!).

#### Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
