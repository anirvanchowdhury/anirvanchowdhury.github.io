Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weatherhead Scholars Program at Harvard University's [Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/). In Fall 2024, I will be starting as the Aung San Suu Kyi Assistant Professor of Asian Democracy at the University of Louisville's [department of political science](https://louisville.edu/politicalscience) and the [Center for Asian Democracy](https://louisville.edu/asiandemocracy). I completed my PhD candidate at the [Charles and Louise Travers department of Political Science](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was a Research Associate at the [Center for the Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/).

I study the links between social norms and political participation with a focus on gender and religious conservatism in South Asia. My dissertation-based book project, [__Domesticating Politics: How Religiously Conservative Parties Mobilize Women in India__](https://anirvanchowdhury.github.io/book/) proposes a theory of _norm-compliant mobilization_ to explain how the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wields social and religious norms to mobilize women. I also explore the wider implications of this mobilization for women's agency in conservative parties and movements, as well as the paradox of democratic backsliding amidst rising political participation in India. This dissertation was awarded with APSA's best dissertation awards in Political Economy (the Mancur Olson award); Religion and Politics (the Aaron Wildavsky award); Women, Gender, and Politics; and Political Communication (the Thomas E. Patterson award). In conjunction with this, a complementary research agenda examines the origins and spread of religious conservatism, how regressive norms can be transformed to foster inclusion, and the effects of inclusion on the marginalized and historically entrenched groups.

My research has been generously supported by the [APSA-NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/ddrig), the [APSA Centennial Center's Women and Politics Fund](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/), the [Weiss Family Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/governance-initiative), the University of Notre Dame's [Global Religion Research Initiative](https://grri.nd.edu/), the University of Gothenburg's [Governance and Local Development Program](https://gld.gu.se/), and [UC Berkeley's Graduate Division](https://grad.berkeley.edu/), [Insitute of South Asia Studies](https://southasia.berkeley.edu/), [Center for Contemporary India](https://indiacenter.berkeley.edu/), and [Center for Right-Wing Studies](https://crws.berkeley.edu/).

### Teaching
#### UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Some of my teaching materials for the class are available here (coming soon!). Some in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!).

#### Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
