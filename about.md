![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and the Aung San Suu Kyi Endowed Chair in Asian Democracy at the University of Louisville's [department of political science](https://louisville.edu/politicalscience) and the [Center for Asian Democracy](https://louisville.edu/asiandemocracy). I study the political economy of development with a regional focus on South Asia, and a substantive emphasis on religion, gender, party politics, and democratization. During Fall 2025, I will be on leave as a Visiting Lecturer at (King's College London)[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/kii].

My research examines the ascendance of majoritarian and populist movements, and their implications for the political represenatation, participation, and inclusion of marginalized groups. Parallel research agendas investigate the dissemmination and sustenance of political ideologies, as well as the links between electoral institutions and democratic health. 

My research has been published in _Science Advances_, and by Cambridge University Press. I am currently working on a [book project](https://anirvanchowdhury.github.io/book/) on how religiously conservative parties mobilize women. This research has received several accolades, including best dissertation and paper awards from the American Political Science Association in Comparative Politics; Political Economy; Religion and Politics; Political Communication; and Women, Gender, and Politics Research. Prior to this, I co-authored a meta-analysis of six field experiments on information and accountability which was published in Science Advances, and as a chapter in Information, Accountability, and Cumulative Learning: Lessons from Metaketa I (Cambridge University Press), adjudged as the Best Book by the APSA's Experimental Research section.

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University's [Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/). I earned my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley in 2023, where I was a Research Associate at the [Center for the Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/). 

My research has been generously supported by the [APSA-NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/ddrig), the [APSA Centennial Center's Women and Politics Fund](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/), the [Weiss Family Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/governance-initiative), the [Global Religion Research Initiative](https://grri.nd.edu/), the [Governance and Local Development Program](https://gld.gu.se/), and [UC Berkeley's Graduate Division](https://grad.berkeley.edu/), [Insitute of South Asia Studies](https://southasia.berkeley.edu/), [Center for Contemporary India](https://indiacenter.berkeley.edu/), and [Center for Right-Wing Studies](https://crws.berkeley.edu/).

### Teaching
#### UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Some of my teaching materials for the class are available here (coming soon!). Some in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!).

#### Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
