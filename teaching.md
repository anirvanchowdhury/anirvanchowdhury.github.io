## UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introducory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). The award is given to at most 9% of GSIs in a department in a particular year.

Some of my teaching materials for the class are on this site (see below). Some of the in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland). Thanks, Sara!

## Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
