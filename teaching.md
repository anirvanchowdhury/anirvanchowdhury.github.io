## UC Berkeley
I was a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods during Fall 2016. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Teaching materials for this class will be available soon! Some of the in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!)

## Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in Fall 2014. This is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for the school's graduate students. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F).
